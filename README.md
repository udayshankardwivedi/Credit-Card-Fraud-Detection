# -Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This repository contains all the code as a part of the project on Credit Card Fraud Detection. The list of input variables include: </br>

ID: ID of each client LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female) EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown) MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others) AGE: Age in years PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months, â€¦ 8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above) PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above) PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above) PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above) PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above) PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above) BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar) BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar) BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar) BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar) BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar) BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar) default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no) </br> </br>

Roughly, the project can be divided into the following sections: </br>
1. Data Exploration and Validation   2. Data Cleaning  3. Model Building and Validation (Logistic Regression)  4. Handling Class Imbalance  5. Feature Engineering 6. Model Building and Validation (Decison Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost) </br> </br>

Model Accuracy obtained from the various algorithms: </br> </br>

**1. Logistic Regression:** 78.833 % </br>
**2. Decision Tree :** 75.03 % </br>
**3. Random Forest:** 81.75 % </br>
**4. XGBoost:** 81. 43 %
